Validation
==========

GPos was built to tackle the problem of future plasma-based high-energy (GeV) and compact positron sources.
The generation process relies mainly on Bremsstrahlung radiation conversion into electron-positron pairs.
To utilize the resulting beams distributions to drive plasma-based structures suitable to capture and accelerate positrons efficiently, further propagating the beams and focusing can be required.

In this section you can find the validation of those key processes in the following pages:
